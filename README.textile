h2(#what-is). %1.% What is Brave Collective Core?

* User management.
* EVE Online API key management.
* Third-party application registration.
* Authentication of users for third-party applications.
* Authorization of EVE API access by users for third-party applications.
* Access control list group/role definition for use by third-party applications.



h2(#installation). %2.% Installation

Development takes place on "GitHub":github in the "core":github-project project.  Issue tracking, documentation, and downloads are provided there.

You will require an installed and running "MongoDB":mongodb installation.  Installation and configuration of MongoDB is beyond the scope of this documentation.

You will require a working and up-to-date "virtualenv":https://pypi.python.org/pypi/virtualenv installation.  The first step is always to create an environment:

<pre><code>virtualenv brave</code></pre>

Once you have this, enter and activate the virtual environment:

<pre><code>cd brave
source bin/activate</code></pre>

Installing the current development version of the Core Service requires "Git":git, a distributed source code management system.  Compilation additionally requires the Python development headers and the OpenSSL development headers.  In Debian/Ubuntu, these are found in packages `python-dev` and `libssl-dev`.
Run the following to download the development version with Git, and _link_ it into your Python runtime:

<pre><code>git clone https://github.com/bravecollective/core.git
cd core
pip install -r requirements.txt -e .</code></pre>

Once you have successfully compiled the Core Service, copy `development.ini` to `local.ini`, and make changes as appropriate.  Finally, bootstrap the EVE API system by running:

<pre><code>paster shell local.ini # or don't mention an INI if you didn't customize
from brave.core.util.eve import populate_calls
populate_calls()

from brave.core.permission.controller import init_perms
init_perms()</code></pre>

You can upgrade to the latest version at any time:

<pre><code>(cd core; git pull; python setup.py develop)</code></pre>

If you would like to make changes and contribute them back to the project, fork the GitHub project, make your changes, and submit a pull request.  This process is beyond the scope of this documentation; for more information, see "GitHub's documentation":github-help.

h2(#running). %3.% Running the Service

Make a copy of @development.ini@ called @local.ini@, update all relevant directives (related to storage of sessions, cache data, and database URI) and run the following to serve content locally:

<pre><code>paster serve local.ini</code></pre>

This will start a development server and present the URL you need to access.  (Generally "http://127.0.0.1:8080":http://127.0.0.1:8080.)  If you wish the server to automatically restart in the event of a change to one of the source files (templates and statically served content are exempt) add the @--reload@ switch.


h2(#admin). %4.% Common admin tasks

There will be UI for these, but in the meantime, here are some hints for doing admin tasks from the paster shell. Do apply common-sense checking along your way to make sure you're touching the right objects.

h3(). %4.1% Making yourself an admin

You must have a character added to your account and selected as primary.

<pre><code>from brave.core.account.model import User
from brave.core.character.model import EVECharacter
from brave.core.permission.model import Permission, WildcardPermission
u = User.objects(username=USERNAME_HERE)[0]
u.admin = True
c = u.primary
p1 = Permission.objects(id='core.*').first()
c.personal_permissions.append(p1)
c.save()
u.save()
</code></pre>
