#This file includes instructions and notices for admins that they should keep in mind when
#updating their core installations to a new version.
#WARNING: Backup your database regularly and before making any changes to it.

***v0.5:***
5ec0143: All usernames and email addresses in the database need to be lowercased.
    brave/core/scripts/case_migration.py should resolve this for you.
ad709e0: It is highly recommended that admins remove all characters whose owners no longer have a valid API key for them.
    brave/core/scripts/delete_orphan_characters.py should resolve this.
3016b8b: KeyID is made unique in the Credentials collection; all duplicate keys must be 
    purged from the database prior to upgrading. brave/core/scripts/fix_key_duplicates.py should resolve this for you.
    Removal of orphaned characters (see ad709e0) is now required.

***v0.5.2+***
6b3c4a5: Changes were made to the populate_calls function. Admins must run populate_calls(True) from paster shell after
    updating to this version. 
    Commands: 
        from brave.core.util.eve import populate_calls
        populate_calls(True)
